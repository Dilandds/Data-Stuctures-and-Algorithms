#Double Hashing

Implement a double-hashing hash table in Java with the necessary helper methods. This hash table has the hash function ℎ(𝑘) = 𝑘 % 𝑁, where k is the key and N is the capacity of the hash table. The collisions are handled using double hashing with the probe function, 𝑝(𝑘, 𝑖) = 𝑖 ∗ {1 + 𝑘%(𝑁 − 1)} where i is the iteration.

#Chaining

Implement a hash table that uses separate chaining using the Java LinkedList class. You are free to choose the number of slots (N) in the hash table and the hash function should be, ℎ(𝑘) = 𝑘 % 𝑁 where k is the integer key. The value inserted is a string
