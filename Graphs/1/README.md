#Bipartite.java 

In graph theory, a bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices can be divided into two
disjoint sets. Every edge in the graph connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
Using <b>breadth-first search (BFS)</b>, design an algorithm to find out whether a graph given as an
adjacency matrix is a bipartite graph.
