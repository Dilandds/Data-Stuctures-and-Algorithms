### Bipartite

In graph theory, a bipartite graph is a graph in which the vertices can be divided into two
disjoint sets. Every edge in the graph connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
Using <b>breadth-first search (BFS)</b>, design an algorithm to find out whether a graph given as an
adjacency matrix is a bipartite graph.

### TC_DFS

Java code to get the transitive closure of a graph using <b>depth-first search (DFS)</b>. The
graph is represented as an adjacency list. The number of vertices of the graph is to be passed
into its constructor
